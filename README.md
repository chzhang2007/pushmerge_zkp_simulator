# Push Merge ZKP Simulator

This codebase is modified from [Pygame Cards by ScienceGamez](https://github.com/ScienceGamez/pygame_cards), which handles graphics and interaction with the mouse and pygame events. The documentation for Pygame Cards can be found [here](https://pygame-cards.readthedocs.io).

You can run the Push Merge ZKP simulator in the file examples/pushmerge_zkp/main.py.

Troubleshooting:
* You may need to create a virtual environment to handle dependencies. If so, to install packages, first activate the virtual environment using the following command: source .venv/bin/activate.
* To run the code, you may need to install the Cairo graphics package on your device.
